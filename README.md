# typings.space ðŸš€

typings.space is a simplistic interpretation of a pleasing typing test ðŸ‘‹

## Features

- Pressing ESC (escape) resets the entire test
- Live WPM overview during test
- History of the last 10 recorded tests
- Tooltips when hovering over incorrect words to show what was typed instead of the word

## Calculation of WPM

The current calculation checks how many correct words were typed over the period of all typed words (incl. incorrect ones). Unsure if I should factor in the length of words. If you have suggestions on how to improve the calculation feel free to create a PR or create an issue.
